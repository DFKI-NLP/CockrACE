================================================================================
General information:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package contains the corpus "CockrACE", a corpus of 140 news articles
annotated with mentions of entities and their coreference links, as well as
relation mentions for the evaluation of relation extraction (RE) experiments.
Three semantic relations have been annotated, each of them dealing with people's
family relationships (marriages, brother/sister, parent/child).

Some differences to corpus "Celebrity" are:
- CockrACE offers a full-document annotation of entities and their relations,
  not just an annotation of sentences with a sufficient amount of essential
  relation arguments
- CockrACE contains coreference links

For more details, see the annotation guidelines in the file "annotation-
guidelines-2014-01-16.pdf"

Data format:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XML files are UTF-8 encoded. Each file corresponds to a news article. The
document text is neither sentence-wise nor token-wise segmented. Relation
mentions and other annotation layers are listed at the end of the files, after
the text of the article. Files can be loaded with the Recon tool.
