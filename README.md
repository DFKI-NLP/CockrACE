# CockrACE
The “CockrACE” corpus consists of 140 news articles annotated with mentions of entities and their coreference links, as well as relation mentions for the evaluation of relation extraction (RE) experiments. Three semantic relations have been annotated, each of them dealing with people's family relationships (marriages, brother/sister, parent/child).
