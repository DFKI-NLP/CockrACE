# CockrACE Corpus
The “CockrACE” corpus consists of 140 news articles annotated with mentions of entities and their coreference links, as well as relation mentions for the evaluation of relation extraction (RE) experiments. Three semantic relations have been annotated, each of them dealing with people's family relationships (marriages, brother/sister, parent/child). This annotation effort is ongoing. We are providing here a snapshot of the (more-or-less) raw annotation. The files can be loaded with the <a href="https://github.com/DFKI-NLP/recon">Recon tool</a>.
